# Lazy-delete-

Here we demonstrate lazy delete in hashing.

Definition: Lazy deletion refers to a method of deleting elements from a hash table that uses open addressing (linear probiing in this demonstration). In this method, deletions are done by marking an element as deleted, rather than erasing it entirely. Deleted locations are treated as empty when inserting and as occupied during a search.

In the following demonstration the input is taken from a text (.txt) file that is included and applies all the functionalities provided, as the user calls them. The numbers in the text file are seperated by '*' & differentiated from one another.
